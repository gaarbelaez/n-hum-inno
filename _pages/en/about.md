## The N-Hum-Inno Common Laboratory

Is interested in the study of digitally supported human-man and human-machine interactions, with the vision of: technology at the service of people. 

Digital technology is used to help and amplify decision-making capabilities in increasingly complex environments (increased information processing, more frequent stakeholder interactions, real vs. virtual interfaces, etc.).

## Shared skills, expertise and resources

N-Hum-Inno is a joint research program funded by the ANR and involves two complementary partners, the ERPI laboratory and the SME TEA.

**TEA** is a French SME leader in measuring human activity in complex real environments. With more than 30 years of experience in R&D and strong links with scientific experts. TEA develops and markets several products for measuring human activity in real or virtual environments.

**ERPI** is a laboratory of[the University of Lorraine](https://univ-lorraine.fr) scientific expertise and knowledge in collaborative innovation processes as well as the evaluation of the experience in collaborative immersive environments will be implemented for the development of shared demonstrators.

This program will allow the development of products and solutions to TEA to access new growth markets (industry 4.0, Neuro-Marketing, smart-city...) as well as the development of shared demonstrators of solutions on specific application markets.

## Research Topics
 - Product acceptability indicators
 - Immersive Collaborative Environments
 - Psycho-pysiological sensors
