**The joint research laboratory: N-Hum-Inno**

Is interested in the study of digitally supported human-human and human-machine interactions, with the vision of :
technology at the service of people.

Digital technology is used to help and amplify decision-making capabilities in increasingly complex environments (increased information processing, more frequent stakeholder interactions, real vs. virtual interfaces, etc.).

## Aims
This research program aims to:

- Facilitate the analysis of human behavior exposed to digital stimuli 
- Generate experience evaluation indicators that take into account the diversity of data and provide useful information to designers and users 
- Implement artificial intelligence tools to deal with data uncertainty
- Develop shared application demonstrators (Industry 4.0, Neuro-Marketing, Smart-City...)

The LabCom is a research program funded by the ANR and involves two complementary partners, the [ERPI laboratory](https://erpi.univ-lorraine.fr) and the SME [TEA](https://teaergo.com/wp/).

**TEA** is a French SME leader in measuring human activity in complex real environments. With more than 30 years of experience in R&D and strong links with scientific experts. TEA develops and commercialize several products for measuring human activity in real or virtual environments.

**ERPI** is a research team on industrial engineering of the [University of Lorraine](https://univ-lorraine.fr). Its scientific expertise is on collaborative innovation processes as well as the evaluation of the experience in collaborative immersive environments. Its experimental platform the [Lorraine Fab Living Lab](https://lf2l.fr) would help to accelerate the development of industrial demonstrators.

This program will allow the development of TEA products and solutions to access new growth markets (industry 4.0, Neuro-Marketing, smart-city...) as well as the development of shared demonstrators of solutions on specific application markets.
