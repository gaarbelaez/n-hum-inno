The [Laval Virtual 2020](https://www.laval-virtual.com) is being held virtually on Laval Virtual World this year during April 22-24 2020.
[N-Hum-Inno](https://n-hum-inno.eu) researchers Giovanny Arbelaez and Anaëlle Hily will present some works developed in the project:

 - Anaëlle will present the paper untitled "Reliability of virtual reality for user experience in spatial cognition: an exploratory approach" authors: Anaëlle Hily, Christel Jacob, Laurent Dupont, Giovanny Arbelaez, Jérôme Dinet and Mauricio Camargo. This work is one the first experimentations of Anaëlle's PhD work and it was also done in collaboration with researchers from the 2LPN laboratory of the University of Lorraine as part of the Inn-Cognitif project funded under the "Interdisciplinarité Call 2019" of the Université de Lorraine.

 - Giovanny will present the paper "Development of an IMU-based ergonomics assessment tool for virtual reality" Authors: Giovanny Arbelaez, Julien Michaux, Mauricio Camargo and Nicolas Ferveur. The paper presents the first tool developed under the N-Hum-Inno project that facilitates the analysis of Human-factors during the design of future work scenarios. The system is based on IMU for motion capture, the Captiv TEA software and a plugging developed in Unity to link VR scenes with the analysis software.
